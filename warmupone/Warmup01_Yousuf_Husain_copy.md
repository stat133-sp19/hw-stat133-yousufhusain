R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**Star Wars**

*A famous quote by Phasma:*

> "You really are a First Order commander through and through, Phasma. You threaten, and whine, and wail, but you never do anything."

**Cooking Recipe**

This is the recipe for baked buffalo wings.

*Ingredients:*

-   1-4 pounds of chicken wings
-   1-2 teaspoons of baking powder
-   1-4 teaspoons of kosher salt
-   2 tablespoons of hot sauce
-   1-2 tablespoons of unsalted butter

*"Special" kitchen tools:*

-   Large baking sheet
-   Aluminum foil
-   Oven-safe cooling rack

*Recipe steps:*

1.  Mix the chicken wings with kosher salt and baking powder and place them on an oven-safing cooling rack in a refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours
2.  Then, heat your oven to 450 degrees and bake the wings for 40 minutes.
3.  Later, make wing sauce by combining the hot sauce and buter in a medium saucepan until the mixture melts.
4.  Finally, roll the wings in the wing sauce.

*Miscellaneous:*

There is no special season for baked buffalo wings, although they are commonly cooked during seasonl events, holidays, and other celebrations. A variation of the recipe is creating blue cheese dressing. The ingredients include buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, white vinegar, garlic, pepper, blue cheese, and chives. The steps include mixing all of the ingredients together until they are combined.

**Euclidean Distance**

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\textbf{p}\\textbf{q}}).$

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, …, *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, …, *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q}, \\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_{1} - p\_{1})^2 + (q\_{2} - p\_{2})^2 + \\cdots + (q\_{n} - p\_{n})^2} \\\\ = \\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_{1} - p\_{1})^2}.$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$\\| \\textbf{p} \\| = \\sqrt{p\_{1}^2 + p\_{2}^2 + \\cdots + p\_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}},$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
